"""Subprocess lifecycle wrapper for the Go accelerator daemon binary.

The daemon binary embeds an in-process Go Bigtable client and exposes the
``google.bigtable.v2.Bigtable`` service over a Unix domain socket. This module
owns spawning the binary, waiting for the UDS to become connectable, and
tearing the process down. It does NOT speak gRPC; that's the
``_AcceleratorClient`` companion's job.
