"""Client-side fallback policy for accelerator-routed RPCs.

A daemon that cannot open any sessions replies ``UNIMPLEMENTED``, and the routing
layer transparently retries the call on the native client. The first
``UNIMPLEMENTED`` reply trips a sticky breaker so a persistently-degraded daemon
stops being dialed at all. A daemon whose subprocess has died mid-flight trips
the breaker immediately — it will never recover.

The same breaker also carries a reversible "degraded" flag, set by the health
monitor when the daemon is up but too starved to answer its own health check;
see :class:`AcceleratorBreaker`.

Any other gRPC error is a real, daemon-served result the native client would
reproduce (the daemon owns retries, so it has already exhausted them), so it is
translated to the corresponding ``google.api_core`` exception and raised without
falling back.

This module is plain sync-only logic shared verbatim by the async and generated
sync clients; ``grpc.RpcError`` is the common base of both ``grpc.RpcError`` and
``grpc.aio.AioRpcError``, so no CrossSync branching is needed here.

    * **Tripped** — permanent. The first ``UNIMPLEMENTED`` reply (the daemon
      understands the RPC shape but has no working sessions), or an explicit
      :meth:`trip` when the daemon subprocess is found dead. Neither condition
      recovers, so the accelerator is abandoned for the life of the Table.
    * **Degraded** — reversible. Set by the health monitor when the daemon stops
      answering its own health check promptly (see
      ``_async/_accelerator_health.py``). A daemon starved of CPU recovers when
      the load that starved it goes away, so this must clear again — routing
      permanently away from the accelerator on one bad minute would be a far
      worse outcome than the slow calls it avoided.

    Keeping the two flags separate is what makes that safe: :meth:`set_degraded`
